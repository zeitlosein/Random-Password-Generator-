Random Password Generator. An Awsome Password Generator


What does the code do? 

The Random Password Generator Code will create a 12-letter string of words (both cases) and numbers each time it's executed. Special characters are added each time as well. 

Each time you run the code, you'll get a random string of characters that is incredibly difficult to hack. 


Why is this useful? 

When you need to change the passwords for users in a database that exceeds more digits than you have on your right hand. The loop function allows you to exponentially generate new passcodes each iteration.
